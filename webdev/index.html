				<h1>It All Starts With the Internet</h1>
				<p>Not only is the internet not going away, it is growing. According to research by <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/about/" target="_blank">the Pew Research Center</a>, 87% of adults in the United States use the internet on a daily basis. With a number like that, I can't think of a reason why a business shouldn't have an online presence.</p>
				<h2>Website Development</h2>
				<div class="ui-grid-a ui-responsive">
					<div class="ui-block-a">
						<div class="jqm-block-content-clear">
							<p>My approach to web development is simple. Find the message you want the user to get. That means forget all the bells and whistles and focus on your primary message and build off of that. That doesn't mean a site can't be unique, but I believe a clean sleek responsive design that only gives the information needed is best for the user. From there we can decide the best way to bring that message across.</p>
							<p>ksolans.com was built using jQuery Mobile libraries without the use of a CMS. It is clean, lightweight, and completely responsive. I've added Google Analytics to the site to track traffic. You can find all the source code for this site on my <a href="https://github.com/fukenny/portfolio" target="_blank">Github account</a>.</p>

				<h2>Content Management</h2>
				<div class="jqm-block-content-clear">
					<p>Content is key. This is what is going to drive people to your site and bring them back again and again. Setting up a system where adding additional content that is simple and user friendly is not the easiest of tasks. Luckily the development of Content Management Systems (CMS) helps take a lot of the pain out of the process.</p>
					<p>I've worked with a global company managing websites in over 15 countries using Joomla! and Liferay. Within that company I worked along side the editorial team to obtain the content to post and the design team to make sure each new page added fits with the companies brand standards. I also worked with the companies Director of Web Strategies to make updates to each of the sites within the company around the globe. With this experience I learned how to communicate effectively across each team I needed to work with and how to multitask and prioritize assignments. This communication became especially important while I was working on websites where the content was not in english.</p>

				<h2>Blogs</h2>
				<div class="jqm-block-content-clear">
					<p>Sometimes a company doesn't need a full website, but has lots of content to share. Or maybe there is a website, but the company wants to show off their ideas and convey personality. I've used Wordpress to set up blogs for clients to manage, as well as run a blog to help promote a product.</p>
