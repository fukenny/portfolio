				<h1>Who is Kenneth Solans?</h1>
				<p>I am a front end developer and Android developer living in Chicago. I chose to get into development for two reasons. It is something I am really good at and I actually enjoy the work. Every day I am reading up on the latest technologies and tips in the industry not because I feel I have to, but because I want to.</p>
				<h2>Professional Life</h2>
				<div class="jqm-block-content-clear">
					<p>Over the years I have had to wear multiple hats in each of the companies I have worked with. I've learned that being good at one thing just isn't enough in today's world. Though I consider myself an expert with HTML/CSS, I also know Adobe Creative Suite. Learning CS made it easier for me to communicate clearly with designers from the print industry all the way to the web.</p>
					<p>While doing content management I learned about SEO and how to optimize a website so it appears higher in search results. While promoting an Android application I had built, I learned how to utilize social media to extend my reach.</p>
					<p>I've worked on projects from the conception of an idea to the final execution. I've learned how to anticipate problems and see where the road block might be. I understand the relationship between the designers, copy editors, branding managers, social media and mobile teams. When all these teams can work together the final product can be a beautiful thing.</p>
					<p>I believe that every problem has a solution. If I don't know how to do something, I will learn how to do it. The resources are out there and one of my strengths is being able to locate those resources.</p>
					<p>I work on a Mac but am also proficient with PC.

				<h2>Personal Life</h2>
				<div class="jqm-block-content-clear">
					<p>Outside of the tech world I can find plenty to keep me busy. I'm a huge fan of music and seeing live shows and going to large festivals. I used to be a lighting and sound technician for a theater after I graduated high school, and still love the technical side of seeing a concert.</p>
					<p>Though it overlaps with my professional life, I sometimes write about the shows I have seen. Sadly the blog I worked with no longer exists.</p>
					<p>I also consider myself a pretty good carpenter. I enjoy being able to see what I have built at the end of the day. I've worked on sets for plays, rebuilt sections of decks and taken on other home improvement projects.</p>
